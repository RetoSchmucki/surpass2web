  - name  : France Gerard
    image : images/team/photoFrance.png
    designation : Earth Observation Scientist
    description : France works on the development of remotely sensed-derived data to constrain and validate models, support process understanding and monitor vegetation. Using remote sensing technology, her research aims to establish the impact of environmental factors and actions of human on ecosystem functioning to inform conservation and enable sustainable management of natural resources.

  - name  : Reto Schmucki
    image : images/team/team_reto.png
    designation : Community Ecologist
    description : Reto's research aims at understanding the drivers and mechanisms that structure and mediate biological diversity at varying scales. Merging empirical work with theory, his research interest are in biodiversity monitoring, modelling trophic interactions and exploring the factors that affect species distribution in the face of global change.

  - name  : Claire Carvell
    image : images/team/ClaireCarvell.png
    designation : Pollination Ecologist
    description : Claire works on ecology and conservation of wild bees and other insect pollinators. Using a combination of field observations, experiments, molecular genetics, analyses of long-term datasets and modelling approaches, her research informs restoration and management of agro-ecosystems to enhance plant and invertebrate biodiversity and interactions between plants and their pollinators.

  - name  : Ben Woodcock
    image : images/team/BenWoodcock2.png
    designation : Ecological Entomologist
    description : Ben works on ecosystem service delivery (biocontrol and pollination), macro-ecology and mechanisms of co-existence in invertebrate communities. His research produces applied solutions to biodiversity management issues, and builds on a mechanistic understanding of the competitive interactions and trade-offs between invertebrates and the plant communities.

  - name  : Dan Morton
    image : images/team/dan_morton2.jpg
    designation : Ecological Remote Sensing Scientist
    description : Dan specialises in the production of and ecological analysis of large scale (national an larger) satellite derived datasets. Using satellite based systems, he harness the potential of these tools to improve our capability to monitor biodiversity, map arable crop and fruit production, and study the impact of modern agricultural practices on wild insect and pollination services.
