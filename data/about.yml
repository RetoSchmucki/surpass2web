  Safeguarding Pollination Services in a Changing World: theory into practice (SURPASS2) is an international partnership between Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the UK, working on pollinators and pollination services in South America. Our main objectives are to develop knowledge, build capacity and define tangible actions for conservation and sustainable use of pollinators. SURPASS2 will deliver evidence for the creation of resilient pollination services for sustainable economic growth, positive environmental and agricultural outcomes and improved human health and wellbeing.

  <br>
  Through our research activities, our consortium focuses on providing knowledge to food producers, policy-makers, land managers and the public who need better evidence based tools to support decision making for sustainable outcomes. By communicating the observed and potential impacts of environmental change based on objective, science based evidence, we will offer improvements to the future cultural and social recognition of the vital roles that pollinators, and those that work with them, play in sustaining crop production and ecosystem functioning.
