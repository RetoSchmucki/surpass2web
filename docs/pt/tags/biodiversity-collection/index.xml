      <description>November - Bioblitz Challenge During November 2020 the Chilean members of SURPASS have launched a Bioblitz to promote the use of iNaturalist across the country. The aim of this initiative is to increase citizen awareness of pollinators, as well as the amount of data on this group of species in the iNaturalist Platform. Observations that are of good quality and their species is identified are automatically inserted into the GBIF Platform.</description>

      <description>Mobilizing Biodiversity Data Over the last year, our partners in Chile have mobilized, standardized, and digitized a century of bee data in Chile. With this effort, our colleagues have secured 100 years of biological recording for generations and made it available to the world via the GBIF portal.
This database presents the largest dataset of Chilean wild bees (Apoidea) with 36,010 records comprising over 40 years of data. This collection is held by the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso, being the largest in the country.</description>
