      <description>Monitoring the status and trends of pollinators and pollination services Evidence of large-scale declines in pollinators exists in North America and Europe, yet relatively little is known of their status and trends in South America. A robust monitoring approach is critical to increase the evidence base for understanding threats to animal pollinators and underpin policies for their sustainable management and conservation.
 In the UK, CEH has led the development of a National Pollinator and Pollination Monitoring Framework, which is currently implementing the UK Pollinator Monitoring Scheme using a combination of volunteer citizen science and professionally led surveys.</description>
